# Sharing Resources
*******************

[MapStore](https://mapstore.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/) offers the possibility to share the resources (*map*, *dashboard* and *Story*) through two different ways:

* Directly from MapStore [Homepage](home-page.md) by clicking on the Share button <img src="../img/button/share.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> present in each resource card toolbar

<img src="../img/share/share_cards.jpg" class="ms-docimage"  style="max-width:400px;"/>

* Inside the resource by selecting the <img src="../img/button/share-button-bm.jpg" class="ms-docbutton" style="max-height:25px;"/> option from [Burger Menu](menu-bar.md#burger-menu) 

From the *Share panel* the user is allowed to save a resource in different ways:

* With a **direct link**

* Through a **social network**

* With **embedded code** or **APIs**

## Link

As soon as the *Share panel* opens, the link section is by default displayed:

<img src="../img/share/share_window.jpg" class="ms-docimage"  style="max-width:400px;"/>

Here the user can copy the resource **URL link** and passed it to a new clipboard or access the shared map through the **QR code**.

## Social

Switch the panel on the social section the user can share the resource on **Facebook**, **Twitter** and **LinkedIn** simply by clicking on the social icon.

## Embed

Switch the panel on the embed section the user can copy the **embedded code** or the **APIs**. It is useful, for example, for inserting the resource inside a webpage.
