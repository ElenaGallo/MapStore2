# Media Section
**********************

Media Section are similar to [Paragraph Sections](paragraph-section.md) but the main difference is that as soon as the user try to add a new Media Section, the [Media Editor Window](media-editor-window.md) appears, asking to define the media that is going to be added. An example of a new Media Section with an image added can be like the following:

<img src="../img/media-section/media-s.jpg" class="ms-docimage"/>

The content of the Media Section can be an image, customized through the [Content Image Toolbar](content-image-toolbar.md), or a map, customized through the [Content Map Toolbar](content-map-toolbar.md).

Once the first media is added to the Media Section it's possible to add new media, text content or web page content or remove the existing ones, just like in the [Paragraph Sections](paragraph-section.md).
