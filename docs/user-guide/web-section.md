# Web Page Section
**********************

The Web Page Section is similar to the Paragraph Section and the Media Section but when the user try to add a new Web Page Section the web page window appears, asking to define the URL of the web page that is going to be added.

An example of a new Web Page Section with a web page added can be like the following:

<img src="../img/web-section/web-page.jpg" class="ms-docimage"/>

Once the first web page is added it is possible to add new web page, text and media content or remove the existing ones, just as it is explained in the [Paragraph Sections](paragraph-section.md).
